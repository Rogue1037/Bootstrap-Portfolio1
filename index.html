                                    <p> My name is Dylan Davidson. I was born in Newport Beach, CA. I have lived in Orange County all of my life. My wife, Linda, and our two kids, Asher (10) and Quinn (7), live in Irvine.Out of College, I began working for PSAV. It is a event technology company, that set up and executed corporate shows, in hotels and specialty venues. During my time there I aquired many production skills. I started as a tech for the company. Essentially, I set up and took down Audio Visual equipment for events at local hotels. I learned how to set up anything from projectors to large venue sound systems. After a few years with the company, I was promoted into Management. I began as a director at a local hotel to running the local warehouse, that accounted for 14 million in revenue a year. With having kids, it is not always easy to get free time. When I do, I enjoy golfing. The local golf course I normally play is Trabbuco Arroyo. I also enjoy skiing and snowboarding with my family in Mammoth.
